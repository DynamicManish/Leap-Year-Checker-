# Leap-Year-Checker-
Hey there,🙋🏻‍♂️

This is a simple LEAP YEAR CHECKETR made with simple Python codes by me:)

An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. 
It simply corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, 3 conditions are used to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.
